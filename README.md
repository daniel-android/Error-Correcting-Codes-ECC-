# Error-Correcting-Codes-ECC-

One of the most interesting and important applications of finite fields has been the development of algebraic coding theory. This theory, which
originated in the late 1940s, was created in response to practical communication problems. Algebraic codes are now used in compact disc and DVD players, 
fax machines, digital televisions, and bar code scanners, and are essential to computer maintenance.

This repository was built to storage some classical Error Correcting Codes for educational purposes. The source code is written in C++.
